# Overview

This program was completed by Cassandra Col&#0243;n, Christopher Miller, and Tara Douglass unless otherwise specified.

The goal of this program is to explore the use of Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms in the context of airline travel. This program allows the user to see all the possible paths between airports and their distance and price from each other. Additionally, given two cities, the user will then be able to see the shortest path available from the two location, either based on distance or on price.

## Running Program

To run this program, do the following:
*  Compile all files in repo
    -  This can be done using the command `javac Graph.java`
*   Run the class with the main method - `Graph.java`
    - This can be done by using the command `java Graph`
